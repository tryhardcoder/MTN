// How do you replace macro defs from CMAKE?
// how are libs substituted with diff configs?
[ ] Better debug/release mode arc
[ ] Better x64 vs x86 arc




Current plan:

For Rendering:
implement a GL api, keeping some sort of arc to make it generic

    Step 1: fill out very basic GL API funcs
    Step 2: Get a mesh drawing
  Step 2.5: VAOS PLEASE LORD ITS BEEN LIKE A YEAR
    Step 3: Better render targets
    Step 4: Better textures
    Step ?: better uniforms (with type info, preferrably)

    Step ?: Research and add a DirectX api

For Physics:
    Step 1: ??????????
